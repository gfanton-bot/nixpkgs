# ðŸš€ My Personal Nix Home Configuration
Welcome to my personal Nix Flake sanctuary, a home for all the custom
configurations that make my digital haven comfy! This versatile setup is
designed for my Mac laptop (Darwin) and some Linux VMs, bringing together the
power of Nix and a range of favorite packages.

This configuration is a fork of
[github.com/malob/nixpkgs](https://github.com/malob/nixpkgs). I hope that my
configuration can also serve as a resource and inspire others in setting up their Nix environments.
